# 🚆 Railway Ticket Reservation System

A console-based **Railway Ticket Reservation System** developed in **Java** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, Java Collections Framework, and Design Patterns. The application simulates a real-world railway reservation system by supporting booking, cancellation, dynamic seat allocation, RAC, waiting list management, and multiple payment methods.
